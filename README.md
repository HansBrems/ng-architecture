# NG Architecture

Work in progress! This will be a sample application that demonstrates how I like to organize Angular applications. It currently contains:

- Components: PrimeNG
- Custom Styling/Grid System: PrimeFlex
- State Management: NRGX
- Linting: ESLint
- Code Formatting: Prettier
- Translations: Transloco

It uses an in-memory API so you can just clone and run it.
