## No longer used

- Reactive forms
- NGRX

## Roadmap

- Defining a locale
- Client-side validation
- Security
- Testing (maybe)

## Folder structure

- Core: for app scoped components, singleton services, etc. Things required to build the shell of the application.
- Shared: Reusable components, directives, and pipes that can be utilized across different parts of the application.
- Feature Modules: Represent distinct functional areas and are not to be confused with Angular modules. A module, is divided into features. A feature consists of a container (smart) component and presenter (dumb) components.
